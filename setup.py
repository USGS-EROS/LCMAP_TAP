"""The Time Series Analysis and Plotting (TAP) tool is being developed to provide visualization and analysis support of
LCMAP products generated with PyCCD.  Multispectral time-series models and calculated indices at a specified point
location are available for plotting.  The plots by default include all ARD observations, PyCCD time-segment model-fits,
time-segment attributes including start, end, and break dates, and datelines representing annual increments on day 1 of
each year.  The tool generates an interactive Matplotlib figure that displays plots for bands and indices selected by
the user via the GUI.
